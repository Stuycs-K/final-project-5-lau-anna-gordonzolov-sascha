## Overview
Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) is a strategic game where players place monkeys on a map to prevent enemy balloons ("bloons") from reaching the end of a set path. When a player pops a bloon, the bloon decreases in class until it disappears. The player earns monkey money upon popping bloons and completing a round. Using this currency, the player can access higher-level Towers. When bloons pass the endpoint, they cause damage to the player's health. Higher-level bloons cost more lives than lower-level ones. The goal is for the player to survive every round of bloons without depleting all of their lives. 
## Instructions
Purchase and place towers onto the map. Press start round to get balloons onto the map. Pop the balloons to earn money and prevent them from reaching the end. Aim to
keep health above zero and pop balloons to purchase better towers.

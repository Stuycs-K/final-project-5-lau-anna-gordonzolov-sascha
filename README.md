## Overview
Bloons Tower Defense (BTD) is a strategic game where players place monkeys on a map to prevent enemy balloons ("bloons") from reaching the end of a set path. When a player pops a bloon, the bloon decreases in class until it disappears. The player earns monkey money upon popping bloons and completing a round. Using this currency, the player can access higher-level Towers. When bloons pass the endpoint, they cause damage to the player's health. Higher-level bloons cost more lives than lower-level ones. The goal is for the player to survive every round of bloons without depleting all of their lives. 
## Instructions
Install the Sound library.
Click the tiles on the sidebar on the right to create a monkey, drag it to a valid area around the path, and click it again to place it down. Continue doing so until you run out of money or until you think you have
enough monkeys. Press the "START" button to begin a round. After each round ends, place any new monkeys and press the "START" button again for the next round. Click on a monkey you have placed in order to upgrade
its radius or sell it. For the purposes of viewing advanced features, press the enter key to skip to later rounds.
